This is a project undertaken as part of an intensive training porgram for Accenture being run by \_nology.

This porject requires the student to create a portfolio using their newly-gained HTML and CSS skills. This portfolio forms the basis, or foundation, upon which the student will, at a later point in time, return and build a more sophisticated portfolio.
