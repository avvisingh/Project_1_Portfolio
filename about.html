            <h3>A bit about my life</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a 23 year old with a keen passion for software development.
                I completed my VCE at Melbourne High School in 2015 and then
                went on to attend The University of Melbourne where I studied a
                Bachelor's in Science, majoring in Microbiology and Immunology.
                Though, I throoughly enjoyed the content presented in my
                Bachelor's degree, I grew to realise that a career as a
                researcher simply wasn't for me. Thus, began my exploration to
                find a career which would provide me with a true sense of
                fulfillment.

                It was when I was tasked with designing a website for a family
                buinessnes, that I was initially introduced to the world of
                software development. From my initial forays into the field of
                web-development, I developed a passion for software development
                in a more holistic sense and, form there, I fell far and fell
                rather quickly down the cliched rabbit hole.
            </p>
            <p>
                From that point onward, I began online introductory CS courses
                and began teaching myself the ins-and-outs of everything
                programming. From C, Java and Python, through to data structures
                and algorithms, myt curiosity propelled me through myriad
                courses and textbooks until I finally felt I was ready to take
                my first big step and start looking for a career as a developer.
