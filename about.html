                    I'm a 23 year old with a keen passion for software
                    development. I completed my VCE at Melbourne High School in
                    2015 and then went on to attend The University of Melbourne
                    where I studied a Bachelor's in Science, majoring in
                    Microbiology and Immunology. Though, I throoughly enjoyed
                    the content presented in my Bachelor's degree, I grew to
                    realise that a career as a researcher simply wasn't for me.
                    Thus, began my exploration to find a career which would
                    provide me with a true sense of fulfillment.

                    It was when I was tasked with designing a website for a
                    family buinessnes, that I was initially introduced to the
                    world of software development. From my initial forays into
                    the field of web-development, I developed a passion for
                    software development in a more holistic sense and, form
                    there, I fell far and fell rather quickly down the cliched
                    rabbit hole. Fast forward a few years, and here I am:
                    knees-deep in the wide world of software development and as
                    enthusiastic as ever.
